Abstract:
As automotive technologies evolve to include advanced connectivity, automation, and electrification, cybersecurity threats pose greater risks that can undermine safety. While current automotive architectures implement cybersecurity controls, additional assurance is required to ensure cyber resilience, especially with increasing integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized approach to developing trustworthy distributed systems resilient to cyber-attacks. This paper reviews blockchain platforms and protocols for enabling cyber-resilient automotive solutions within the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We analyze key blockchain properties including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, access controls, and privacy mechanisms. We also examine blockchain projects aimed at the automotive industry for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, electric vehicle charging, and autonomous transactions. Furthermore, we discuss the role of edge computing in meeting real-time and scale requirements for blockchain in vehicular systems. While blockchain delivers cybersecurity benefits, we outline challenges related to latency, standardization, governance, and adoption. As connected, electric, and autonomous vehicles become pervasive, blockchain can potentially provide inherent cyber resilience to keep pace with growing threats in an IoT ecosystem. With appropriate edge computing integration, blockchain systems for next generation automotive solutions can be designed for security, safety, and sustainability.
