### Abstract:
The evolution of digital technology brought about the phases
of Web1.0, Web2.0, and presently, the adoption of Web3.0
technologies. Researchers have shifted their focus to ex-
ploring the potential applications of Web 3.0 in e-learning.
Leveraging Web3.0 tools within e-learning stands to enhance
its adaptability, intelligence, and dependability, aiming to op-
timize the current system. By integrating features like widget
aggregation, intelligent retrieval, user interest modeling, and
semantic annotation, Web3.0 technologies have the potential
to significantly improve the E-learning experience. Users
are increasingly seeking a more sophisticated and tailored
internet experience to improve learning management, user
interaction, and resource collaboration. Consequently, the
emergence of Web3.0 brings forth transformative possibilities
within the E-learning landscape. This article aims to show-
case the integration of Web 3.0 technology into e-learning,
analyzing its current usage and anticipating future challenges
